            Log in to the OpenStack Dashboard (Horizon):
Access the OpenStack Dashboard using a web browser. The URL will depend on your OpenStack deployment. Typically, it is something like http://<your-openstack-controller-ip>/dashboard.

Log in with Administrative Credentials:
Log in to Horizon using administrative credentials (an account with administrative privileges).

Navigate to the Admin Panel:
In the Horizon dashboard, navigate to the admin panel. This is usually found in the top-right corner of the dashboard, and it might be labeled as "Admin," "Identity," or something similar.

Access the "Project" Section:
Within the admin panel, find the "Projects" or "Project" section. This is where you can manage projects (tenants) and their quotas.

Select the Relevant Project (Tenant):
Choose the project (tenant) for which you want to increase the quotas. If you are working on the default project, you can usually find it labeled as "admin" or "Default."

Adjust Quota Limits:
Look for an option like "Modify Quotas," "Set Quotas," or something similar. This is where you can adjust the quota limits for the selected project.

Increase Volume Quota:
Locate the quota limit related to volumes. It might be labeled as "Volumes," "Gigabytes," or something similar. Increase the limit to the desired value.

Save Changes:
After making the necessary changes, save the modifications.

Verify Changes:
Double-check that the quota limits have been updated as expected. You can do this by navigating to the "Quotas" section or by viewing the project details.

Please note that the exact steps and terminology might vary slightly depending on the version of OpenStack you are using and the specific Horizon dashboard configuration. If you encounter any difficulties or if the steps above don't match your OpenStack deployment, refer to the official documentation or consult with your OpenStack administrator for guidance.
